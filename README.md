# BlackJack

First Python project created in Jupyter Notebook!

# Introduction on how to play BlackJack (though there are various other ways): 
- The goal of the game is to add up the values of your cards and try to get that value as close to, or equal to, 21 without       going over.
- Assume only two people are playing: You and the dealer.
- The dealer gives you one card facing up and one card facing down, and the dealer gives him/herself the same.
- You (before the dealer) have two choices now: to either add another card to the two you already have (hit) or do nothing         (stay).
- Now it's up to the dealer to hit or stay, and depending on who gets closer to 21 (without going over) wins the game.
- Simple enough, but things get complicated when you throw an Ace in the mix: If you are dealt an Ace, you can choose whether     that Ace will equal 11, or equal 1.  


The code is split in such order to initalize classes and define methods to be used for the actual game, which is coded in [84]. There is then an example of a BlackJack game between the dealer and someone.





While the format is in Jupyter Notebook, there's a great conversion tool if you'd like to fork this repo and change the language or code:   https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert.git
